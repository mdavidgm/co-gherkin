## 🚀 What is Co-Gherkin?

Co-Gherkin brings the power of Gherkin (Given-When-Then) syntax to Vitest, the blazing-fast test runner for modern JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Why "Co"?

Inspired by **co-working** philosophy, Co-Gherkin promotes **collaborative testing** where:
- ✅ Product managers write scenarios in plain English
- ✅ Developers implement step definitions
- ✅ QA validates behavior automatically
- ✅ Everyone speaks the same language

### The Problem

- ❌ **Cucumber.js** doesn't work with Vitest
- ❌ **Playwright BDD** is E2E only, not for unit/integration tests
- ❌ **No native Gherkin support** in Vitest ecosystem

### The Solution: Co-Gherkin
```gherkin
Feature: User Login
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should see the dashboard
```
